The [FireLoop] integration is built in the SDK, so you just need to generate one and install it by using the CLI Tool.

````sh
$ cd myproject
$ fireloop

It is important to note that you should [create an application] by using the [FireLoop] CLI Tool prior this procedure.

Also, when you create new [FireLoop] Models, you may want to rebuild the SDK for any of your client applications using the same procedure we just followed.
